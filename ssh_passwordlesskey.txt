## ssh passwordless login

	A. generate a public key ( this will create id_rsa / id_rsa.pub files in ~/.ssh folder )
		ssh-keygen
		
		# ex: prompt to comeplete	
		Generating public/private rsa key pair.
		Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press Enter key]
		Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press Enter key]
		Enter same passphrase again: [Pess Enter key]
		Your identification has been saved in /home/heoyea/.ssh/id_rsa.
		Your public key has been saved in /home/heoyea/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
		The key fingerprint is:
		33:b3:fe:af:95:95:18:11:31:d5:de:96:2f:f2:35:f9 heoyea-core@.192.168.1.100

	B1. copy local pub key to server pc (method 1)
		# this will send pub key and create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on server pc
		# Note: ssh-copy-id command will append keys, not overwrite it ( good for multiple keys)

		ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub heoyea-core@192.168.1.100

	B2. copy local pub key to server pc (method 2)
		# send keys to server
		scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub heoyea-core@192.168.1.100:/tmp/

		# login to server pc then append keys manually
		cat /tmp/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

		# remove public key file from tmp folder
		rm /tmp/id_rsa.pub
